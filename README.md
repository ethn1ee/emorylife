# EmoryLife

The digital heartbeat of Korean community at Emory University. Or at least a place to post pictures of the campus squirrels.

## What is this thing?

Welcome to EmoryLife, the over-engineered solution to finding out what's happening on campus. It's a modern social platform built for the Emory Korean community where you can:

- **Share** photos and information.
- **Browse** posts by category.
- **Comment** on your friend's mom's 101th post about pre-med.
- **Connect** your (or your child's) Emory email and prove you belong.

Think of it as a slightly more organized Yik Yak, but with less anonymity and more code.

## The Magic Behind the Curtain (Tech Stack)

This project is built with the latest and greatest, probably because we like to suffer.

- **Next.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **tRPC**
- **Prisma**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Shadcn/UI**

## Running Locally

1.  `pnpm install`
2.  `pnpm dev`
3.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and pray.
